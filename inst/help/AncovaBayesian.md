Bayesian ANCOVA
===
 
The Bayesian ANCOVA allows the user to analyze the difference between multiple group means, while taking into account the effect of variables that have an influence on the dependent variable but are not part of the experimental manipulation (i.e., covariates).

### Assumptions
- The residuals are normally distributed for every group.
- The independent variables are categorical, the dependent variable is continuous.
- The variance of the dependent variable is the same for every group. This is called homogeneity of variances.
- The groups are independent.
- For each independent variable, the relationship between the dependent variable and the covariate is linear.
- The effect of the covariate on the dependent variable does not differ between groups. This is called homogeneity of the regression slopes.

### Input
---
#### Assignment Box
- Dependent Variable: The variable of interest. This is also called the outcome variable.
- Fixed Factors: The variables that are manipulated/define the different groups. These are also called the independent variables.
- Random Factors: In this box, the variable can be selected that should be included in all models, including the null model.
- Covariates: In this box, the variable that is the covariate can be selected. Covariates are continuous variables that influence the dependent variable but are not part of the experimental manipulation.

#### Bayes Factor  
- BF<sub>10</sub>: By selecting this option, the Bayes factor will show evidence for the alternative hypothesis relative to the null hypothesis. This option is selected by default.
- BF<sub>01</sub> : By selecting this option, the Bayes factor will show evidence for the null hypothesis relative to the alternative hypothesis. This is equal to 1/BF<sub>10</sub>.
- Log(BF<sub>10</sub>) : By selecting this option, the natural logarithm of BF<sub>10</sub>, BF<sub>m</sub>, BF<sub>Inclusion</sub>, BF<sub>10, U</sub> will be displayed in the output.

#### Output 
- Effects: By selecting this option, the inclusion probability of each component (i.e., model term) in the models  will be calculated.   
    - Across all models: When this option is selected, each model where the component is included will be used to estimate the effect (i.e., inclusion probability) of the component. When the option `Effects` is selected, this method is used by default.
    - Across matched models: When this option is selected, only models with exactly that component will be included in the analysis. Therefore, interactions with the component are excluded. Compares models that include the component to equivalent models excluding the component. Higher-order interactions are excluded. Analysis suggested by Sebastiaan Math√¥t.

      </details>

- Estimates: By selecting this option, a table with the model averaged posterior summary will be displayed. This table includes information about the model averaged posterior mean, the standard deviation, and the credible interval for each level of the fixed factors, their interactions, and the covariates.  
- Descriptives: When this option is selected, the mean, standard deviation, and the sample size will be displayed for each level combination of the independent variables.
  - Credible interval: Central credible interval. By default this is set to 95%.
 
#### Order 
- Compare to null model: The models used for the analysis constructed under the option `Model` will be compared to the model containing the grand mean and the random factors, called the null model. This option is selected by default.
- Compare to best model: The models used for the analysis constructed under the option `Model` will be compared to the best model included in the analysis.

#### Plots
- Model averaged posteriors: By selecting this option, plots illustrating the model averaged posterior distribution of each fixed factor, interaction, and covariate will be displayed.
  - Group levels in single plot: When this option is selected, one plot for each factor will be displayed. Therefore, the posterior distribution of each level of the factor will be shown in the same plot.  
  - Individual plot per level: When this option is selected, a plot for each level of the factors will be displayed. Therefore, the posterior distribution of each level of the factor will be shown in a different plot.
- Q-Q plot of residuals: Checks the validity of the distributional assumption of the data set. Specifically, the plot shows whether the residuals are normally distributed.
- Posterior R<sup>2</sup>: By selecting this option, a plot of the posterior distribution of the R<sup>2</sup> (i.e., explained variance) will be displayed.

### Model
- Components: All the independent variables, and covariates that can be included in the model.
- Model terms: The independent variables and covariates included in the model. By default all the fixed factors are located in this box.  
- Add to null model: The independent variables and covariates included in the model can be selected to add to the null model.  

### Single Model Inference
- Here, a single model can be specified to obtain information about the posterior of this specific model, including a table with the posterior summary and plots of the marginal posterior.
  - Assignment Box: Here, the single model is specified.
    - Components: This box contains all the factors and covariates included in the model.
    - Specific model terms: Select the factors and covariates that should be included in the model.
  - Tables:
    - Estimate: A table with the posterior summary for the single model, specified in the assignment box, will be displayed. This table provides information about the single model posterior mean, the standard deviation, and the credible interval for each level of the fixed factors, their interaction, and the covariate included in the model. This is different from the `estimate` option in Output, since the `estimates` option provides the posterior summary averaged over all the models included in the analysis, while this option gives the posterior summary for the single specified model only. 
  - Plots:
    - Marginal posteriors:  By selecting this option, plots illustrating the posterior distribution of each fixed factor, interaction, and covariate included in the single model will be generated.
      - Group levels in single plot: When this option is selected, one plot for each factor  will be displayed. Therefore, the posterior distribution of each level of the factor will be shown in the same plot.
      - Individual plot per level: When this option is selected, a plot for each level of the factors will be displayed. Therefore, the posterior distribution of each level of the factor will be shown in a different plot.
    - Q-Q plot of residuals: Checks the validity of the distributional assumption of the data set. Specifically, the plot shows whether the residuals are normally distributed.
    - Posterior R<sup>2</sup>: By selecting this option, a plot of the posterior distribution of the R<sup>2</sup> (i.e., explained variance) for the specified model will be shown.
  

### Post Hoc Tests
- To perform a post hoc test, drag the factor name to perform the post hoc test on to the right column.

  Then it is possible to select:

        - Standard error: By selecting this option, the error bars will represent standard errors of the mean of each level combination of the independent variables.
    - Fix horizontal axis to 0: Forces the graphs to show the default x-axis at y = 0.

### Additional Options

    - r scale fixed effects: The shape parameter of the prior distribution for the fixed effects. This is set to 0.5 by default, but this can be changed into the desired value.  
    - r scale random effects: The shape parameter of the prior distribution for the random effects. This is set to 1 by default, but this can be changed into the desired value.
