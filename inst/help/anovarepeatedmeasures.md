Repeated Measures ANOVA
===

The repeated Measures ANOVA allows the user to analyze the differences between means, when observations are dependent.

### Assumptions
- The dependent variable is normally distributed for every group.
- The covariate and the experiment effect are independent.
- The assumption of sphericity is met. Sphericity entails that the variances of the differences of the repeated measures conditions all have the same variance.

### Input
---

#### Assignment Box
- Repeated Measures Factors: The within-subjects (repeated measures) variable. Here the repeated measures factors of interest and the different levels that belong to the factor can be labelled.
- Repeated Measures Cells: The separate columns in the data frame that represent the levels of the repeated measure(s) factor(s).
- Between Subject Factors: When the subjects have been assigned into two or more separate groups this variable can be selected.
- Covariates: In this box the variable that is the covariate can be selected. Covariates are continuous variables that have an influence on the dependent variable but are not part of the experimental manipulation.

#### Display
- Descriptive statistics: When this option is selected, the mean, standard deviation, and the sample size will be displayed for each level combination of the repeated measures factors.
- Estimates of effect size: By selecting this option, the specific types of calculations to estimate the effect size can be specified.
    - &eta;<sup>2</sup> : When this option is selected, the eta-squared is calculated as an estimate of the effect size. However, this method is considered to overestimate the population variance, making it hard to compare the effect of the same variable across different studies (Goss-Sampson, 2018).
    - partial &eta;<sup>2</sup> : When this option is selected, the Partial eta-squared is calculated as an estimate of the effect size. This method is considered to solve the problem of overestimation of the population variance, which makes it less difficult to compare the effect of the same variable from different studies (Goss-Sampson, 2018).
    - general &eta;<sup>2</sup> : When this option is selected, the Generalized eta-squared is calculated as an estimate of the effect size.
    - &omega;<sup>2</sup> : When this option is selected, the Omega squared is calculated as an estimate of the effect size. This is considered a good estimate when the sample size is small (Goss-Sampson, 2018).
- Vovk-Selke maximum p-ratio: The bound 1/(-e p log(p)) is derived from the shape of the p-value distribution. Under the null hypothesis (H<sub>0</sub>) it is uniform (0,1), and under the alternative (H<sub>1</sub>) it is decreasing in p, e.g., a beta (α, 1) distribution, where 0 < α < 1. The Vovk-Sellke MPR is obtained by choosing the shape α of the distribution under H1 such that the obtained p-value is maximally diagnostic. The value is then the ratio of the densities at point p under H<sub>0</sub> and H<sub>1</sub>. For example, if the two-sided p-value equals .05, the Vovk-Sellke MPR equals 2.46, indicating that this p-value is at most 2.46 times more likely to occur under H1 than under H<sub>0</sub>.

### Model
- Components and model terms:
  - Repeated Measures Components: All the repeated measures factors and covariates that can be included in the model.
      - Model terms: The repeated measures factors and covariates that can be included in the model.
  - Between Subjects Components: All the between subjects factors and covariates that can be included in the model.
      - Model terms: The repeated measures factors and covariates that can be included in the model.

- Sum of Squares: There are different types of the sum of squares. The choice of the type is important when there are multiple factors and when the data are unbalanced. In an unbalanced design, the different levels of the repeated measures factor do not contain an equal number of observations (e.g., one group contains more observations than another group). In this scenario, the sum of squares type can influence the results.   
    - Type I: Sequential sum of squares. It is the reduction of error when each factor of the model is added to the factors already included, preserving the order of factors in the model. The results depend on the order in which the factors are added to the model. This is important to consider when the model contains more than one factor.
    - Type II: Hierarchical/partially sequential sum of squares. It is the reduction of error when each factor is added to the model that includes all the other factors, except the factors where the added factor is a part of, such as interactions containing that factor. Langsrud (2003) advises to apply this type for an ANOVA with unbalanced data.
    - Type III: Partial sum of squares. It is the reduction of error when each factor is added to the model that includes all the other factors, including interactions with this factor. This type is often selected, because it takes interactions into account (Langsrud, 2003). This type is selected by default.
- Use multivariate model for follow-up tests:  By selecting this option, the multivariate linear model, rather than the aov model, will be used for follow-up tests (contrasts, post-hoc tests, marginal means). Multivariate tests likely provide a better correction for violations of sphericity.

### Assumption checks
- Sphericity tests: Sphericity entails that the variances of the differences of the repeated measures conditions all have the same variance.
- Sphericity corrections: If sphericity is not met, then the test will have increased false positive rate. One approach to correcting this is to reduce the degrees of freedom by sphericity corrections.
  - None: No correction is performed.
  - Greenhouse-Geisser: This correction varies between 1/(k − 1), where k is the number of repeated-measures conditions, and 1.
  - Huyn-Feldt: Another common method to correct the degrees of freedom is Huynh-Feldt correction.
- Homogeneity tests: By selecting this option, it will be checked whether the variance of the dependent variable is equal between the groups by performing Levene's test of equal variances. This test is only suitable for assessing equal variance for between subjects factors. For repeated measures, the sphericity test is more suitable. 

### Contrasts
For each repeated measures factor, a specific contrast can be selected by clicking on `none` in the right column. Contrasts specified here only apply to the contrast table, not to the main analysis.  
- Factors: These are the repeated measures factors included in the analysis.  
- Contrasts: Contrasts enable the analysis of planned comparisons. There are different contrasts that enable different types of comparisons:
    - none: By selecting this option, no contrasts are calculated. This option is selected by default.
    - deviation: By selecting this contrast, the mean of each level of the repeated measures factor is compared to the overall mean (the mean when all the levels are taken together).
    - simple: When this contrast is selected, the mean of each level is compared to the mean of a specified level, for example with the mean of the control group.
    - difference: This contrast is also called reverse Helmert. By selecting this contrast, the mean of each level is compared to the mean of the previous levels.
    - Helmert: When this contrast is selected, the mean of each level is compared to the mean of the subsequent levels. This is the reverse of the difference contrast.
    - repeated: By selecting this contrast, the mean of each level is compared to the mean of the following level.
    - polynomial: This contrast tests polynomial trends in the data. The specific polynomial that will be used for the analysis depends on the number of levels of the repeated measures factor. The degree of the trend used for the analysis is the number of levels minus 1. Therefore, if the repeated measures factor consist of 2 levels, a linear trend is analysed. If the repeated measures factor consists of three levels, a quadratic trend is analysed in addition to the linear trend.
    - custom: Here, the contrast weights can be specified manually. Some weights need to be non-zero.
- Assume equal variances: This option can be selected when the variances of the levels of the independent variable are assumed to be equal. 
  - Confidence interval: Confidence interval for the location parameter. By default, the confidence interval is set to 95%. This can be changed into the desired percentage.


### Post Hoc Tests
- Confidence intervals: When this option is selected, the confidence interval for the mean difference is calculated. This is done for every post hoc method except for Dunn. By default this is set to 95% but this can be adjusted into the desired percentage.
To perform a post hoc test, drag one or more factor names to the right column. Several options are available:    
- Effect size: By selecting this option, the effect size (i.e., the magnitude of the observed effect) will be displayed. The used measure for the effect size is Cohen's d. The effect size will only be displayed for the post hoc type `Standard`.
- Pool error term for RM factors: A pooled error term assumes that the variances of the contrast scores are approximately equal (i.e., sphericity assumption) See Morey (2008) for more details.
- Correction: To correct for multiple comparison testing and avoid Type I errors, different methods for correcting the p-value are available:  
    - Tukey: Compare all possible pairs of group means. This correction can be used when the groups of the repeated measures have an equal sample size and variance. This method is commonly used and is selected by default.
    - Scheffe: Adjusting significance levels in a linear regression, to account for multiple comparisons. This method is considered to be quite conservative.
    - Bonferroni: This correction is considered conservative. The risk of Type I error is reduced, however the statistical power decreases as well.
    - Holm: This method is also called sequential Bonferroni, and considered less conservative than the Bonferroni method.

    - Flag Significant Comparisons: Add asterisks to the table to indicate 3 levels of significance.

### Descriptives Plots
To create a descriptive plot, select the repeated measures factor to be placed on the horizontal axis. If there are more than one repeated measures factor, the variables can be displayed in one plot by putting the other variable in the box Separate lines, or the variables can be displayed in separate plots by selecting the other variable in the box Separate plots.
- Factors: The repeated measures factor included in the analysis.
- Horizontal axis: Select the repeated measures factor that should be displayed on the horizontal axis of the plot.
- Separate lines: By placing a repeated measures factor in this box, different lines corresponding to the different levels of the repeated measures factor will be displayed.
- Separate plots: By placing a repeated measures factor in this box, different plots corresponding to the different levels of the repeated measures factor will be displayed.
- Label y-axis: The label of the y-axis can be changed manually.
- Display:
    - Display error bars: By selecting this option, error bars will be displayed in the plot. The error bars can either represent confidence intervals or standard errors. In order to get accurate confidence intervals and standard errors, the data are normalized by subtracting the appropriate participantʹs mean performance from each observation, and then adding the grand mean score to every observation. The variances of the resulting normalized values in each condition, and thus the size of the bars, no longer depend on the participant effects and are therefore a more accurate representation of the experimental manipulation. See Morey (2008) for a thorough discussion of this procedure.
        - Confidence interval: This option is selected by default. With this option, the error bars will represent confidence intervals of the mean of each level combination of the repeated measures factors. By default the confidence interval is set to 95%, but this can be changed  into the desired percentage.
        - Standard error: By selecting this option, the error bars will represent standard errors of the mean of each level combination of the repeated measures factor.
    - Average across unused RM factors: When there are multiple RM factors in the model, but only plotting a subset of these factors, the mean is taken across the unused RM factors. For instance, when there are two RM factors with two levels in the model, A (1&2) and B (1&2), and only A is selected to be plotted, the average is taken of B across its levels. This means that when the mean of A1 is plotted, it is actually the average of A1B1 and A1B2). This procedure is discussed by Loftus & Masson (1994). When the box is not ticked, the averages are not taken, and the columns A1B1 and A1B2 are simply concatenated.


### Marginal Means
- Marginal means: When this option is selected, the mean for each level of the repeated measures factor, adjusted for all the other variables in the model, is calculated.
- From `...` bootstraps: When this option is selected, the bootstrapped marginal means are calculated. By default, the number of replications is set to 1000. This can be changed into the desired number.
- Compare marginal means to 0: By selecting this option, the adjusted means are compared to 0 and the confidence intervals of the adjusted means are calculated.
    - Confidence interval adjustment: The confidence intervals can be adjusted in several ways.
        - None: When this option is selected, no adjustment will be applied.
        - Bonferroni: Bonferroni correction of the confidence intervals.
        - Sidak: Sidak correction of the confidence intervals.
