ANCOVA 
=== 

ANCOVA allows the user to analyze the difference between multiple group means, while taking into account the effect of variables that have an influence on the dependent variable but are not part of the experimental manipulation (i.e., covariates). 

### Assumptions 
- The residuals are normally distributed for every group.
- The independent variables are categorical, the dependent variable is continuous. 
- The variance of the dependent variable is the same for every group. This is called homogeneity of variances. 
- The groups are independent. 
- The covariate and the experiment effect are independent. 
- The effect of the covariate on the dependent variable does differ between groups. This is called homogeneity of the regression slopes. 

### Input 
--- 
#### Assignment Box 
- Dependent Variable: The variable of interest. This is also called the outcome variable. 
- Fixed Factors: The variables that are manipulated/define the different groups. These are also called the independent variables.  
- Covariates: In this box the variable that is the covariate can be selected. Covariates are continuous variables that have an influence on the dependent variable but are not part of the experimental manipulation.  
- WLS Weights: Weighted Least Squares, here the variable specifying which points have more weight and are therefore considered more informative can be selected. For this last option it is important to know the weights a priori. This option is primarily used when the errors are heteroskedastic. 

#### Display: 
- Descriptive statistics: When this option is selected, the mean, standard deviation, and the sample size will be displayed for each level combination of the independent variables. 
- Estimates of effect size: By selecting this option, the specific types of calculations to estimate the effect size can be specified. 
    - &omega;<sup>2</sup> : Omega squared is calculated as an estimate of the effect size. This is considered a less biased estimate of the effect size, compared to  &eta;<sup>2</sup> . (Kroes & Finley, 2023). 
    - partial &omega;<sup>2</sup> : Partial Omega squared is calculated as an estimate of the effect size.  Partial &omega;<sup>2</sup> measures the effect size of the predictor in the context of multiple factors or covariates, isolating its unique contribution.
    - &eta;<sup>2</sup> : Eta-squared is calculated as an estimate of the effect size. However, this method is considered to overestimate the population variance, making it hard to compare the effect of the same variable across different studies (Goss-Sampson, 2018; Kroes & Finley, 2023).       
    - partial &eta;<sup>2</sup> : Partial eta-squared is calculated as an estimate of the effect size. Partial &eta;<sup>2</sup> measures the effect size of the predictor in the context of multiple factors or covariates, isolating its unique contribution.
- Vovk-Selke maximum p-ratio: The bound 1/(-e p log(p)) is derived from the shape of the p-value distribution. Under the null hypothesis (H<sub>0</sub>) it is uniform (0,1), and under the alternative (H<sub>1</sub>) it is decreasing in p, e.g., a beta (α, 1) distribution, where 0 < α < 1. The Vovk-Sellke MPR is obtained by choosing the shape α of the distribution under H1 such that the obtained p-value is maximally diagnostic. The value is then the ratio of the densities at point p under H<sub>0</sub> and H<sub>1</sub>. For example, if the two-sided p-value equals .05, the Vovk-Sellke MPR equals 2.46, indicating that this p-value is at most 2.46 times more likely to occur under H1 than under H<sub>0</sub>.

### Model 
- Components and model terms: 
    - Components: All the independent variables and covariates that can be included in the model. 
    - Model terms: The independent variables and covariates included in the model. By default, all the main effects and interaction effects of the specified independent variables, and the covariates are included in the model.
  <details>
    <summary><b>GIF demonstration: Add interaction </b></summary>
    <img src="%HELP_FOLDER%/gif/interaction_effect_anova.gif"/>
  </details>
                                                                                      
- Sum of Squares: There are different types of the sum of squares. The choice of the type is important when there are multiple factors and when the data are unbalanced. In an unbalanced design, the different levels of the independent variable do not contain an equal number of observations (e.g., one group contains more obsevations than another group). In this scenario, the sum of squares type can influence the results.   
    - Type I: Sequential sum of squares. It is the reduction of error when each factor of the model is added to the factors already included, preserving the order of factors in the model. The results depend on the order in which the factors are added to the model. This is important to consider when the model contains more than one factor. 
    - Type II: Hierarchical/partially sequential sum of squares. It is the reduction of error when each factor is added to the model that includes all the other factors, except the factors where the added factor is a part of, such as interactions containing that factor. Langsrud (2003) advises to apply this type for an ANOVA with unbalanced data. 
    - Type III: Partial sum of squares. It is the reduction of error when each factor is added to the model that includes all the other factors, including interactions with this factor. This type is often selected, because it takes interactions into account (Langsrud, 2003). This type is selected by default. 


### Assumption Checks 
- Homogeneity tests: By selecting this option, it will be checked whether the variance of the dependent variable is equal between the groups by performing Levene's test of equal variances.  
- Q-Q plot of residuals: Checks the validity of the distributional assumption of the data set. Specifically, the plot illustrates whether the residuals are normally distributed.

### Contrasts
- For each independent variable, a specific contrast can be selected by clicking on `none` in the right column. 
  <details>
    <summary><b>GIF demonstration: Select contrast </b></summary>
    <img src="%HELP_FOLDER%/gif/contrasts_anova.gif"/>
  </details>


  - Factors: These are the independent variables included in the analysis (i.e., the variables selected in the `Fixed Factors` box).  
  - Contrasts: Contrasts enable the analysis of planned comparisons. There are different contrasts that enable different types of comparisons:
      - none: By selecting this option, no contrasts are calculated. This option is selected by default. 
      - deviation: By selecting this contrast, the mean of each level of the independent variable is compared to the overall mean (the mean when all the levels are taken together).
      - simple: When this contrast is selected, the mean of each level is compared to the mean of a specified level, for example with the mean of the control group. 
      - difference: This contrast is also called reverse Helmert. By selecting this contrast, the mean of each level is compared to the mean of the previous levels. 
      - Helmert: When this contrast is selected, the mean of each level is compared to the mean of the subsequent levels. This is the reverse of the difference contrast. 
      - repeated: By selecting this contrast, the mean of each level is compared to the mean of the following level. 
      - polynomial: This contrast tests polynomial trends in the data. The specific polynomial that will be used for the analysis depends on the number of levels of the independent variable. The degree of the trend used for the analysis is the number of levels minus 1. Therefore, if the independent variable consist of 2 levels, a linear trend is analysed. If the independent variable consists of three levels, a quadratic trend is analysed in addition to the linear trend. 
      - custom: Here, the contrast weights can be specified manually. Some restrictions apply here: (1) some weights need to be non-zero (2) The maximum number of contrasts is the number of factor levels - 1 (3) for factors with more than 2 levels, at least 2 contrasts need to be specified.
- Confidence Intervals: By selecting this option, confidence intervals for the estimated mean difference and effect size will be included. By default the confidence level is set to 95%. This can be changed into the desired percentage. 
- Effect size: Include standardized mean differences, based on the effectsize function in the emmeans package. 


### Post Hoc Tests
- To perform a post hoc test, drag one or more factor names to the right column. Several options are available:    
  - Type: Different types of post hoc tests can be selected. 
  -  Standard (LSD): Pairwise t-tests are performed. All the corrections can be applied to this method. This option is selected by default. 
      - Confidence intervals: When this option is selected, the confidence interval for the mean difference is calculated. This is done for every post hoc method except for Dunn. By default this is set to 95% but this can be adjusted into the desired percentage.  
      - From `...` bootstraps: By selecting this option, the bootstrapped post hoc test is applied. By default, the number of replications is set to 1000. This can be changed into the desired number. 
      - Effect size: By selecting this option, the effect size (i.e., the magnitude of the observed effect) will be displayed. The used measure for the effect size is Cohen's d. The effect size will only be displayed for the post hoc type `Standard`. 
      - Conditional comparisons for interactions: Instead of pairwise comparisons for all possible combination of cells in the interaction, list pairwise comparisons conditional on each of the interaction terms. This provides as many tables as there are terms in the interaction effect.  
  -  Games-Howell: This method can be used when equal group/level variances are not assumed. The p-values are corrected with the Tukey method.
  -  Dunnett: When selecting this method, all the levels are compared to one specific level, for example to the control group. At the moment, it is not possible to manually specify to which level the others levels are compared, but it is based on the order of the levels. To change the order of the levels, the level labels can be adjusted.

    <img src="%HELP_FOLDER%/gif/labelediting.gif"/>
  </details> 
      
  - Correction: To correct for multiple comparison testing and avoid Type I errors, different methods for correcting the p-value and confidence interval for mean difference are available (note that the confidence intervals for effect sizes can only be adjusted using the Bonferroni method):  
      - Tukey: Compare all possible pairs of group means. This correction can be used when the groups of the independent variable have an equal sample size and variance. This method is commonly used and is selected by default. 
      - Scheffe: Adjusting significance levels in a linear regression, to account for multiple comparisons. This method is considered to be quite conservative. 
      - Bonferroni: This correction is considered conservative. The risk of Type I error is reduced, however the statistical power decreases as well. 
      - Holm: This method is also called sequential Bonferroni, and considered less conservative than the Bonferroni method. 
  - Flag significant comparisons: Add asterisks to the table to indicate 3 levels of significance.
  - Letter-based grouping table: Set up a compact letter display of all pair-wise comparisons, based on 'multcomp::cld' and emmeans.

### Nonparametrics
- Kruskal-Wallis test: The Kruskal-Wallis test is a non-parametric ANOVA and can be used to compare two or more groups. This test is a rank-based one-way ANOVA. The Kruskal-Wallis test can be performed when one of the following assumptions is not met: normality of the dependent variable, no outliers, homogeneity of the variance between the groups. To perform the test, move the independent variables from the left column to the right column. 
- Estimates of effect size: request effect size estimates for the Kruskal-Wallis test: rank epsilon squared and rank eta squared, including their confidence interval. Based on the effectsize package. 
-  Dunn's post hoc tests: This is a non-parametric follow-up test that can be used for testing small subsets of pairs. This post hoc test is a follow up for the Kruskal-Wallis test. The p-values are corrected with the Bonferroni and Holm methods.
